        "The idea of creating the (2 min blog)  is to just put my thoughts on topics related to tech or any other random topics that will take literally  2 mins or less than 2  mins to read. According to Google, the average wpm(word per minute) of an average person is 150-200. This means that a person can read around 150-200 words per minute. So keeping in mind this analysis, I got an idea why not let's create a blog website where I can put blogs that will exactly contain 400-500 words which is a lot and still takes 2 mins to read.",
